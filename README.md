# Purpose
The goal of this script is to generate a coverage graph by utilizing data produced from the CLC Genomics workbench. 

# Explanation 
In the CLC Genomics workbench, the "QC for Targeted Sequencing" module generates a csv file that includes the following headers: "Mapping, Reference position, Name, Region, Target region position, Reference base, Coverage." This R script will generate a graph and save it as a .png file for each csv file found in the directory specified by the user.
